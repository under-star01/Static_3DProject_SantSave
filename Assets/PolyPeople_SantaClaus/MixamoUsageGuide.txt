■ To use Mixamo animations

The following steps show one way to apply Mixamo animations to the models included in this package.

1. Upload the FBX file from your Unity project to Mixamo.
   *If you want to use auto-rigging, use the FBX files in the NoArmature folder.
   If the animations provided by Mixamo or other services are not fully compatible with the Humanoid rig included in this package, this issue may be resolved by using the auto-rigging tools offered by those services.

2. Choose any animation and download it with skin.
   (Adjust values such as Arm-Space if necessary.)

3. Import the downloaded FBX into your Unity project.

4. To use the downloaded FBX directly, assign a material to the mesh and set the Rig to Humanoid.
   Then, drag and drop the animation clip onto the character in the Scene — Unity will automatically create an Animator and apply the animation.

5. If you want to combine it with other animation clips,
   you can copy and separate the animation clip from the imported FBX.
   This clip can be used with the included prefabs by dragging it onto the prefab,
   or added to any custom Animator Controller.

Note:
When setting the rig to Humanoid, make sure all bones are correctly assigned in the Configure window.
Occasionally, optional bones such as Chest may not be auto-assigned and may need to be set manually.
